# python-hirst-dot-painting
Hirst Dot Paintings are specific random colored patterns that look appealing after its completed.
This python project creates a replication of the Hirst Dot Painting on the Canvas.
I have used Python turtle module & Object Oriented Programming to implement this functionality.
